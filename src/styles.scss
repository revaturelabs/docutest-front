// This is for the router outlet
// When a router outlet is used, it appends the component as a sibling.
// Therefore in order to give the sibling (or host as I refer to it) a class, we must do it in the 
// child components 'host metadata' or 'hostbinding' (See: css-dashboard-component.ts)
// This styling affects the host whenever css dashboard is a child of it.
